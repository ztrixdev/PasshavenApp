# Passhaven
## The ultimate local-only secrets manager

>  Sure, you can self-host a password manager like Vaultwarden, but that requires either a rented VPS or a 24/7 running home server.

  Passhaven, on the other hand, offers you a free (as in freedom) approach to managing your secrets. The vault, just like in [Aegis](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis) (from which I took inspiration to create Ph),
  is stored fully encrypted and protected only on your phone. An Internet connection is not required to log into your vault and see your passwords,
  a cloud server is not needed. Both the encryption and storage happen on your phone. Using our automatic password-protected backup system, while also following the [3-2-1 backup rule](https://www.veeam.com/blog/321-backup-rule.html), 
  you can build an unbreachable digital fortress that will store your sensitive information just right, unless, of course, you share your Passhaven PIN and MP with everyone on your Discord server. In that case.. there is probably no hope for your personal data >:3
